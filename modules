/* OVERVIEW OF MODULES

    MODULE -> reusable piece of code that 
    encapsulates implementation details, can 
    be a standalone file but not always. 
    -> allows isolation
    -> abstracts code (low-level code can
      just be imported)
    -> leads to organized codebase
    -> allows reuse

    NATIVE JS (ES6) MODULES
    -> modules are stored in files, exactly one module per file
    -> scoped to module, strict mode, this undefined, can import and export, asynchronous file downloading
    -> imported synchronously, makes bundling and dead code elimination possible, is a live connection and not a copy
